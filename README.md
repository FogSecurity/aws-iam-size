# aws-size
Checks Hard to Find Size Limits and Usage for AWS, including IAM.

For support or questions, we can be reached at info@fogsecurity.io.

## Overview

AWS services and resources have limits that can impact development.  These limits (sometimes referred to as Service Quotas) can sometimes be adjustable (soft limits) or not (hard limits).  In some cases, these can make development difficult.  

Currently, this tool focuses on AWS resources including IAM and visibility into some of those limits that can impede development.  

Imagine a scenario where someone is trying to apply least privilege and has appropriately used condition keys, granular IAM actions, and resources in their IAM policies.  They may need to add another statement or action, but if they're out of character space - they will need to think creatively on how to adjust the policy.  This tool will help bring visibility into those limits.

## Running aws-size

Prerequisites:
* Python
* AWS Credentials

To install required libraries, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` can be run.

To run aws-size, the following command can be run:

```
python3 aws-size.py --profile <your_profile_here> --region us-east-1
```

```
? Select a resource limit (Use arrow keys)
 Â» AWS IAM Managed Policies
   AWS EC2 User Data
```

Note: Region is only necessary if choosing resources that are regional such as EC2 instances and user data.  IAM is a global service.

Example output:

```
Customer Managed Policies Scanned: 82
Customer Managed Policies with usage over 90%: 2

List of policies with more than 90% character usage: 
arn:aws:iam::123412341234:policy/<bigpolicy>
Policy Usage: 90.48%
Characters Left: 585
```

### Customization: Setting Threshold

By default, aws-size reports resources with equal or over than 90% usage.  For customization, aws-size supports the `--threshold` argument.  This argument takes a number between 0 and 1 inclusive to set the threshold of resources for reporting.

For example, setting the threshold to 0.75 will report resources with 75% or more usage.  

```
python3 aws-size.py --profile <your_profile_here> --threshold 0.75
```

If you want to return all resources, set the threshold to 0.  Additionally, threshold can be set to all.

Example commands:

```
python3 aws-size.py --profile <your_profile_here> --threshold all
python3 aws-size.py --profile <your_profile_here> --threshold 0
```
